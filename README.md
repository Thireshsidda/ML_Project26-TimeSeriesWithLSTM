# ML_Project26-TimeSeriesWithLSTM

### Time Series Forecasting with LSTM Networks
This project demonstrates a time series forecasting approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Keras. The model is trained on historical passenger arrival data to predict future passenger numbers.

### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

##### Data Loading:
The code reads the "airline-passengers.csv" file using pandas, assuming it contains a single column named "Passengers".

##### Data Conversion:
The DataFrame is converted to a NumPy array for better performance with TensorFlow.

The data type is cast to float32 for compatibility with the LSTM model.

##### Normalization (Scaling):
A MinMaxScaler is used to scale the data between 0 and 1. This helps the LSTM model converge faster and train more effectively.

##### Train-Test Split:
The data is split into training and testing sets using a 67/33 ratio. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

### Feature Engineering
##### Sequence Creation:
A function create_dataset is defined to transform the data into sequences of input and output features.

The function takes a look_back parameter, which specifies the number of past data points to use as input for predicting the next value.

### Model Building
##### Sequential Model:
A sequential LSTM model is created using Keras.
##### LSTM Layer:
The model has a single LSTM layer with 4 units. The look_back parameter from the feature engineering step determines the number of time steps the LSTM layer can process.
##### Dense Output Layer:
The model has a single dense output layer with one unit for single-step prediction.
##### Compilation:
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (mse) loss function.
##### Model Training
The model is trained on the prepared training sequences for 100 epochs.


### Evaluation and Prediction
##### Prediction:
The model is used to predict passenger arrivals for both the training and testing sets.
##### Inverse Transformation:
The predicted values are inverse-transformed back to the original scale using the MinMaxScaler.
##### Error Calculation:
The root mean squared error (RMSE) is calculated to evaluate the model's performance on both the training and testing sets. A lower RMSE indicates better performance.
##### Visualization:
The original data, training set predictions, and testing set predictions are plotted together to visualize the model's learning and forecasting capabilities.

### Key Points
This is a basic example using a single LSTM layer. More complex architectures and hyperparameter tuning can improve performance.

The look_back parameter determines the model's ability to capture historical patterns for prediction.

Time series data may exhibit seasonality or trends that require additional techniques for accurate forecasting.

### Further Exploration
Explore different LSTM architectures (stacked layers, bidirectional LSTMs).

Experiment with various hyperparameters (number of layers, units, learning rate).

Apply the model to different time series datasets (financial markets, sensor data).

Integrate the model into a real-world application for forecasting sales, inventory, or resource usage.
